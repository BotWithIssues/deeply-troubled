# deeply-troubled
A bot that runs on multiple platforms that is designed to create GitHub issues for users without a GitHub account

My usecase is for me to run deeply-troubled as a Reddit bot for the [Slide for Reddit iOS subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/slide-ios), but integration for IRC and Discord are coming

### TODO
